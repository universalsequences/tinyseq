; Acoustic guitar — digital waveguide string model
; Based on a reference patch with proper one-pole LP compensation and body resonances.
;
; Key differences from basic Karplus-Strong:
; - stretch is computed to give exact T60 decay, compensating for the LP's attenuation
;   at the fundamental: stretch = pow(0.001, 1/(sustain*freq)) / |H(e^j2πf/sr)|
; - LP group delay is subtracted from the nominal delay length to keep pitch accurate
; - Body resonances (bandpass filters at guitar body modes) add acoustic realism
; - Pluck position comb on the exciter (bridge vs neck tonal character)
