# tinyseq

A terminal-based step sequencer for sample playback, built in Rust with a lock-free audio engine. Inspired by hardware sequencers like the Cirklon and Elektron boxes.

## Features

- **Step sequencer** with up to 64 tracks and 64 steps per track
- **Per-step parameter locks** (p-locks) for duration, velocity, transpose, chop, and two aux sends
- **Multi-pattern bank** with clone, delete, and instant switching
- **Per-track effects chain**: built-in filter and delay, plus custom DSP effects written in a Lisp dialect (DGenLisp) that hot-compile into the audio graph
- **Embedded control Lisp via `eseqlisp`** for scratch scripting, hook-based pattern automation, and in-app instrument/effect editing
- **Global reverb bus** with per-track send levels
- **Polyphonic voice pool** with chord recording
- **Keyboard playing and recording** with quantized step input
- **Sample browser** with folder tree navigation and audition
- **Per-track step count** (polymetric patterns) with page navigation
- **Lock-free audio engine** (C-based audiograph library) with real-time safe graph editing
- **Piano keyboard visualizer** showing currently sounding notes
- **Mouse support** for clicking steps, tracks, params, and pattern buttons
- **ratatui TUI** that fits in any terminal

## Requirements

- **macOS only** -- the DGenLisp effect compiler depends on Metal for GPU-accelerated DSP
- Rust toolchain
- C compiler (Xcode command line tools)

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```

The audiograph C library is compiled automatically via `build.rs` + `cc`.

## Running

```
cargo run --release
```

On first launch, tinyseq creates `samples/` and `effects/` directories in the working directory. Drop `.wav` files into `samples/` (nested folders are fine) and they'll appear in the sidebar browser.

## Quick start

1. Press **Ctrl+N** to open the sample browser
2. Navigate folders with **Up/Down**, expand/collapse with **Enter**
3. Select a `.wav` file to add it as a new track
4. Press **Tab** to focus the step grid
5. Press **Enter** to toggle steps on/off
6. Press **Space** to play/stop

The audio runs through a C-based lock-free graph engine (`audiograph/`) that supports real-time node addition, removal, and parameter changes without blocking the audio thread.

## Custom effects

tinyseq supports custom DSP effects written in DGenLisp, a Lisp dialect that compiles to native shared libraries. Place `.dgenlisp` source files in the `effects/` directory and load them via **Ctrl+L**. Effects are hot-compiled in a background thread and patched into the audio graph on completion.

## `eseqlisp` integration

tinyseq now embeds [`eseqlisp`](https://github.com/universalsequences/eseqlisp) for control scripting and editing.

- Custom instrument/effect editing runs inside the terminal UI instead of shelling out to `vim`
- `Ctrl+G` opens a fullscreen scratch buffer for live sequencer scripting
- Scratch can query and mutate pattern data, register timed hooks, and is saved with project files
- Project load restores scratch text and cursor position, but does not auto-run saved scratch code or hooks

`eseqlisp` is intentionally separate from DGenLisp:

- **DGenLisp** is the DSP/instrument/effect language
- **eseqlisp** is the control/UI/agent language

## Dependencies

- **ratatui** + **crossterm** -- terminal UI
- **cpal** -- cross-platform audio output
- **hound** -- WAV file loading
- **cc** -- C compiler integration for audiograph
